# Additional Custom Element Lifecycle

## Built-in lifecycle.

* constructor
* connectedCallback
* attributeChangedCallback
* disconnectedCallback

## Extended Lifecycle

### connectedCallback
(Still working on more creative names)

The outline below is more of a thought process than named callbacks or hooks.

* pre-template-lit
* post-template-lit
* pre-paint
* post-paint

Example
```
...
connectedCallback(){
  
}

templateLit(){

}
```
