## My github blog

I have an older blogspot or blogger site. I never got it configured correctly and all the info in there is old. Starting over and giving gh pages a try.

(When I tried to monitize my old blogger site, more for experience than money, everything got messed up.  That later prevented my youtube monitization request from being approved 10 years ago.  That is the only reason I'm not a huge youtube star now.  Well that and the fact that my content does not have a very broad appeal.)
